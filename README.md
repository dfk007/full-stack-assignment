 This code snippet is a basic Node.js server using the Express framework to handle HTTP requests. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

1. **Server Setup**: The server is set up to listen on port 3001 the `app.listen` method.

2. **Signup Endpoint**: When a POST request is to '/signup', the server expects to receive an email and password in the request body. It then adds the email and password to the `USERS` array, but only if the user with the given email doesn't already exist. It responds with a status code 200 regardless of the outcome.

3.Login Endpoint**: When a POST request is made to '/login', the server expects to receive an email and password in the request body. It then checks if a user with the provided email exists in the `USERS` array and verifies if the password matches. If the password matches, it responds with a status code 200 sends back a token. If the password doesn't match, it responds with a status code 401.

4 **Questions Endpoint**: When a GET request is made to '/', the server responds with all the questions in the `QUESTIONS` array.

5. **Sub Endpoint**: When a GET request is made to '/submissions the server should return the user's submissions for a specific problem, but the logic for this is not yet implemented.

6. When a POST request is to '/submissions', the server should let the user submit a problem. However, the logic for accepting or rejecting the solution randomly and storing the submission in the `SUBMISSION` array is not yet implemented. The server responds with a 'Hello World!' message.

7. The code also includes a comment about creating a route that an admin add a new problem and ensuring that only admins can do that, but it's as a hard todo and is not yet implemented.

Overall, server handles user sign-up, login, retrieval of questions, and submission of problems, but some functionalities are not fully implemented as indicated by the comments in the code.
